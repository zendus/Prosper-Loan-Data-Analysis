# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Fourteen of those features were used in this analysis. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1581581520570000) with feature documentation available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000)

## Summary of Findings

During exploration, I discovered that number of loans a customer has negatively affect their access to loans in the future as well as the loan amount. High income earners and home owners all have access to higher loan amount. 

Apart from the main variable of interest, california, labelled in the data as CA has the highest frequency of loans and also showed strong positive correlation with Debt consolidation meaning that many of the borrowers resided in CA and most of them listed debt consolidation as their reason for accessing loan. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I highlighted the variables that affect the loan amount. First, I displayed the loan amount distribution followed by income range distribution. A steady upward slope can be seen in the income range plot. Next I displayed the distribution of borrower state and listing category clearly to show the uptick of california. and debt consolidation respectively. 

Then, I introduced a bivariate plot of income range and loan amount to show proof of the fact that high income earners access higher loan amount. Finally, I displayed the distribution of five states including california across listing categories to show the correlation between debt consolidation and CA upticks in their univariate plots. 
On the side, it was discovered during exploratory analysis is that even though debt consolidation is popular, it has lower prosper score.
